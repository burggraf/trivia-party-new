# Trivia Party Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality First
All code MUST pass linting, type checking, and formatting standards before commit. Every function and class MUST have clear, descriptive names and comprehensive documentation. Code complexity MUST be justified - prefer simple, readable solutions over clever optimizations unless performance requirements demand otherwise.

*Rationale: Maintainable code reduces technical debt and enables rapid iteration on trivia game features while ensuring reliability during game sessions.*

### II. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation. Every feature MUST have unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests covering normal operation and edge cases. Test coverage MUST exceed 85% for all new code. Tests MUST be fast (<30s full suite) and reliable (no flaky tests).

*Rationale: Trivia games require high reliability - question rendering, scoring, and multiplayer functionality cannot fail during gameplay. TDD ensures features work correctly under all conditions.*

### III. User Experience Consistency
All UI components MUST follow consistent design patterns, typography, and interaction models. Response times MUST be predictable (<200ms for UI interactions). Error messages MUST be user-friendly and actionable. Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be met for all interfaces.

*Rationale: Trivia games depend on smooth, intuitive interactions. Inconsistent UX disrupts game flow and reduces player engagement.*

### IV. Performance Standards
Database queries MUST complete within 100ms for single question retrieval and 500ms for bulk operations. Memory usage MUST remain stable during extended game sessions. Client applications MUST maintain 60fps during animations and transitions. All images and assets MUST be optimized for fast loading.

*Rationale: Performance directly impacts player experience - slow question loading or laggy interactions break game immersion and can cause players to leave.*

### V. Data Integrity and Security
All user inputs MUST be validated and sanitized. Database transactions MUST be atomic and consistent. Personal data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit. API endpoints MUST implement proper authentication and authorization. Trivia questions and answers MUST be protected from client-side tampering.

*Rationale: Trivia games handle competitive gameplay where data integrity prevents cheating and maintains fair play. Security protects player privacy and prevents unauthorized access to question databases.*

## Performance Standards

All features MUST meet these performance benchmarks:
- Question loading: <100ms per question
- Game state updates: <50ms response time
- Concurrent players: Support 100+ simultaneous players per game room
- Database operations: <500ms for complex queries, <100ms for simple lookups
- Memory usage: <500MB RAM for typical game sessions
- Bundle size: <2MB for client applications

Performance testing MUST be automated and run on every release candidate.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements
Every pull request MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer. Reviews MUST verify:
- Constitutional principle compliance
- Test coverage and quality
- Performance impact assessment
- Security considerations
- Documentation completeness

### Quality Gates
No code MAY be merged that:
- Fails any automated tests
- Reduces test coverage below 85%
- Introduces performance regressions
- Violates accessibility standards
- Contains security vulnerabilities

### Release Process
All releases MUST include:
- Full test suite execution
- Performance benchmark validation
- Security scan completion
- Documentation updates
- Database migration testing (if applicable)

## Governance

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional changes require:
1. Proposed amendment documented with rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing codebase
3. Team consensus (unanimous approval required)
4. Migration plan for affected code
5. Updated version number following semantic versioning

**Compliance Reviews**: Constitutional adherence MUST be verified during:
- Every pull request review
- Sprint retrospectives
- Major feature design reviews
- Pre-release quality audits

**Version Management**: Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- MAJOR: Breaking changes to core principles or governance
- MINOR: New principles or expanded guidance
- PATCH: Clarifications and refinements

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-09-23 | **Last Amended**: 2025-09-23
