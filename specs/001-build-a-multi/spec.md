# Feature Specification: Multi-User Trivia Game

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-multi`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a multi-user trivia game that's designed to be played in a room with multiple teams and multiple players on a team, with one party organizer who set up the game in advance and invites players to the game.  The game is played on trivia night, and the host displays the questions and answers on TV projection system.  Players can also view each question and available answers in real-time on their smartphones after logging into the specific game.  The TV will display a QR code that players can scan to join the game.  The host will control displaying the pre-game slides, start "rounds" of play consisting of several multiple-choice questions.  Teams will answer questions by tapping the correct answer button on their phone.  The game will make sure that only one answer can be submitted per team.  The host will advance to the next question and next round as they wish.  The host also displays the current scores, final scores, and post-game slides as desired."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A party organizer creates a trivia game in advance and sets up questions organized into rounds. During trivia night, the organizer projects the game onto a TV where players can see a QR code to join. Players scan the QR code with their smartphones, join teams, and participate by selecting answers to multiple-choice questions displayed on both the TV and their phones. The host controls the game flow, advancing through questions and rounds while displaying live scores. Teams can only submit one answer per question, and the game tracks scores throughout all rounds until final results are displayed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an organizer has created a game with questions, **When** they display the game on TV, **Then** a QR code appears for players to join
2. **Given** a player scans the QR code, **When** they join the game, **Then** they can select or create a team and see the current question
3. **Given** a team member selects an answer, **When** they submit it, **Then** other team members cannot submit a different answer for that question
4. **Given** the host advances to the next question, **When** the question changes, **Then** all players see the new question and answer options on their phones and the TV
5. **Given** a round is completed, **When** the host displays scores, **Then** current team standings are shown to all participants
6. **Given** all rounds are finished, **When** the host displays final results, **Then** final scores and rankings are presented

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player loses internet connection during a round?
- How does the system handle players joining mid-game?
- What occurs if multiple team members try to submit answers simultaneously?
- How are teams managed if players need to switch teams or leave?
